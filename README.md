# TimezoneBotReddit

Timezone Bot is a bot that parses posts and comments from Reddit /r/all and tries to find dates and times with timezone info, to provide user information when the event actually happens in format ("2PM PST happens when this comment is 5 hours and 30 minutes").

The bot makes it easier to see and understand when something actually happens. Because Reddit is international forum, users use different timezones to tell time, which makes it for other users hard and painful to find when it actually happens.
